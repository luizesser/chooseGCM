Description: Methods to help selecting General Circulation Models (GCMs) 
    in the context of projecting models to future scenarios. It is provided
    clusterization algorithms, distance and correlation metrics, as well as
    a tailor-made algorithm to detect the optimum subset of GCMs that recreate
    the environment of all GCMs as proposed in Esser et al. (2025) <doi:10.1111/gcb.70008>.
