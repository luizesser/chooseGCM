The goal of `chooseGCM` is to help researchers aiming to project Species Distribution Models and Ecological Niche Models to future scenarios by applying a selection routine to the General Circulation Models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `chooseGCM` from [GitHub](https://github.com/luizesser/chooseGCM) with:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luizesser/chooseGCM")
```

The package is also available on CRAN. Users are able to install it using the following code:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("chooseGCM")
```

## Other packages

If you liked `chooseGCM`, get to know our other packages. Currently, we have also the [`caretSDM`](https://github.com/luizesser/caretSDM) package, a package to run Species Distribution Modeling, which is also used in the article

to test `chooseGCM` using SDMs.

Three breakthroughs distinguish `caretSDM`:

1.  The strong geoprocessing background that allows for automation on spatial data handling by rescaling data to a common grid, with the possibility to model distributions using river networks (via segmented lines), overcoming limitations for aquatic species, while also enabling interactive data viewing without the use of an external GIS software;

2.  The underlying ML tools that allows for the integration of 115+ classification algorithms with automated workflows, from hyperparameter tuning to ensemble prediction, eliminating coding barriers for advanced techniques, while allowing flexibility for experienced users;

3.  The use of recyclable objects, designed to track all analysis steps within a single class, enhancing transparency and scientific rigor.

`caretSDM` is available on both GitHub and CRAN:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luizesser/caretSDM")
```

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("caretSDM")
```
